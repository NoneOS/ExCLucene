To analysis ClueWeb data, please following these steps(all programs in src directory):
1. Decompress all archives which will be analyzed
2. Execute program compiled from CluewebParse.java, the main path arguments in code should be modified
     variable origin_folder_path: refer to path of input archies directory
     variable begin_subfoler_number: refer to the last four digits of begin subdirectory of corpus.
              e.g., if original subdirectories of Clueweb are EN0001,EN0002,....,EN1000, 
                    begin_subfoler_number should be 0001
     variable end_subfoler_number: refer to the last four digits of last subdirectory of corpus.
              e.g., for example above, end_subfoler_number could be 1000
     variable output_folder_path: refer to the output directory for final result
     variable debug_path: refer to the output directory for debug logs

For Gov2, the steps are almost same. Just note begin_subfoler_number & end_subfoler_number should be the 
last three digits of subdirectories. e.g., if subdirectories are GX000,GX001,...,GX200, values should be 
000 and 200, respectively.
